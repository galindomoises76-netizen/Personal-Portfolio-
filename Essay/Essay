#Honestly, I'm the most surprised by AI, especially with this new application.
#AS someone without prior technical experience in programming, being able to create this site without much programming knowledge is quite impressive. 
Every day I realize how much it has advanced and that AI is a tool with a thousand more uses if you know how to use it.
I find it amazing what good prompting can achieve, and that how a site like this could previously take more than two weeks to build with people coding day and night, today, with tools like Cursor with  just three or four hours of good coding vibes and good prompmt, you can generate impressive designs and functionalities.
Evethough I think that is required a minimal base knowledge of Tech so, we dont trust blindly on what IA is giving us.
I hope this is just the tip of the iceberg and that the uses of AI continue to surprise me for future tasks, not only in my academic field but also professionally.
